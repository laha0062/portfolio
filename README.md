Final Project for MTM6201
Create a README.md file and save it at the root of your site. In the readme file add information assuming that you are asked to explain the following about your portfolio in an interview, "Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?" Finally, include a list of any assets or resources you used that was not your own, including any frameworks, libraries, plugins, fonts, or images. You will need to use the markdown language to format your README.md file. 

## The process
I started by marking down the wireframe markups at both mobile and full-width sizes then began creating the base HTML structure of the homepage based on the borders drawn on the wireframes. I repeated this process for each page before styling them via Bootstrap 5. Using the main.css file, I added additional stylings to some of the elements like the skip links and social media icons on each page. 

## Challenges
The biggest challenge I encountered while creating this page was learning to utilize Bootstrap to style and build the web pages. I had limited knowledge of Bootstrap and many of the features within it, only understanding the basic concepts of its grid and flex systems and had to learn more advanced applications like creating a responsive navbar. To overcome these challenges, I first wrote code in the main.css file to better understand what I wanted to achieve. Then I would read through Bootstraps documentation to learn how to accomplish it using their utility classes. 

## What I learned
Through creating this web portfolio, I learned better code formatting via applying Bootstrap, how to use Bootstrap as a whole, and how to better apply responsive web design techniques to build more professional-looking responsive web pages.
